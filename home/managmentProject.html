          <h2>Diversity in the Workplace</h2>
          <p>
            Our topic pertains to how to manage an increasingly diverse workforce. In today's rapidly evolving global landscape, it’s imperative to effectively manage diversity in the workplace. As organizations strive to cultivate environments that are inclusive, equitable, and reflective of the diverse communities they serve, the importance of embracing diversity goes beyond mere compliance. It is a strategic imperative for driving innovation, enhancing employee engagement, and fostering sustainable growth. Through this platform, we aim to provide valuable insights, practical strategies, and resources to support organizations in navigating the complexities of managing diversity, empowering them to create workplaces where every individual feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and talents.
          </p>
          <h2>The Diversity Spectrum</h2>
          <p>
            The first of our subtopics is religious diversity, this is crucial as it is one of the fastest-growing diversity groups in the workforce. Managers must understand and respect their employees' religion to have an effective and motivated workforce. They have to be sure not to accidentally discriminate against an employee's religion as it is a First Amendment right, Riggs will be focusing on this aspect. Our next sub-topic is gender diversity, Ethan will focus on this aspect of our website. Managers must also understand how to handle gender diversity, historically women have been harassed and discriminated against in the workforce, and this has led to numerous lawsuits and a decrease in productivity. Our next sub-topic is LGBTQ diversity, Isaac will focus on this part of the website. Another exponentially growing group in the workforce, the LGBTQ community has been historically discriminated against, managers must be trained and educated to make an inclusive environment for this community. Our second to last sub-topic is racial diversity, this is possibly the oldest of the diversities found in the workforce, but even to this day, they face harassment. Managers must be trained in how to make this group feel welcome in the workforce. The last sub-topic is mental health diversity, which Logan will be focusing on. Mental health issues are on the rise in America, and that will be reflected in the workforce. This group may struggle with the typical work environment that managers need to be flexible to get the most out of their employees.

        <p>
          The dynamics of religious diversity in human resources management are heavily influenced by the diverse religious beliefs of the employees in a business. Religious diversity can be broken down into two topics, inclusion and valuing the differences in religions. More than 80% of the world holds some religious belief, making there growing concerns for workplace conduct. Religious Diversity can help you understand your employees, which can make their religious beliefs more valuable and boost their confidence at work 
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>    
          <b>The importance of religious diversity in the workplace</b><br><br>
          More than 85% of people around the world identify themselves with a religious belief, with only 7% claiming to be completely non-religious people. This is an incredibly vast majority of the population, and it shows us that true workplace diversity should accommodate religion as well. <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>You and your team will be able to create more innovative ideas and will better your relations with customers</li><br>
            <li>Everyone loves the respect that they receive, and acknowledging religious inclusion and empathy will create a company environment where respect is a priority when it comes to workplace interactions.</li><br>
            <li>Companies that are well known for their culture and religious appreciation will have a better reputation for adults looking for a job and students coming out of college. This positive light can boost your company’s morale.</li> <br>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The benefits of religious diversity in the workplace</b><br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>It can boost a greater understanding of cultures, creating a more pleasant environment to work in. Your employees will feel more comfortable knowing their religion/views are accepted in the workplace. </li><br>
            <li>Different cultures and religions can help creativity and innovation. They can bring different perspectives from their culture to share ideas that may be unfamiliar to other employees in the workplace. </li><br>
            <li>Bringing in employees with different religions can also help with customer relations. The more diverse backgrounds you have in the workplace, the more customers you can have by creating a bigger audience to reach and finding common ground with customers, adding more revenue for a company.</li><br>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The drawbacks of religious diversity in the workplace</b><br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Balancing religious freedom with legal requirements and company policies can be delicate. Employers must navigate anti-discrimination laws while also respecting employees' rights to practice their religion.</li><br>
            <li>Religions and beliefs of employees can clash, and trying to work out the best situation for everyone can be challenging.</li><br>
            <li>It may also present challenges in terms of accommodation and potential conflicts. Misunderstandings and misinterpretations of religious beliefs can occur without having proper training on how to handle situations. </li><br>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Inclusive language and communication</b><br><br>
          Correct language and communication are important to avoid stereotyping and non-inclusive language use. There is quite a bit of misinformation and misconceptions of religions and if it is not questioned it is easy to be absorbed by all the negatives. Some examples would be knowing how to pronounce the Hijab and other Muslim cultures. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>  
          <b>Useful tips for inclusion of religious diversity in the workplace</b><br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Supporting employees by creating certain times to build their faith in their religion and having set out locations to do so will be helpful. As for Muslims, you can offer prayer mats and other items that go into their religious practices.</li><br>
            <li>Creating culture awareness days for your employees can also be a good step in the right direction. You can support these days by offering employees to bring in food from their culture and acknowledge the day. These days can be easily recognized by having a calendar with all of the important dates.</li><br>
            <li>Provide training to all employees that include all the historical patterns and disadvantages of Muslims and other religious-based groups. Using correct and inclusive language makes them feel more comfortable at work. Most people who are involved in religion have experienced some type of hate crime against them resulting in them being afraid to worship their religion. Making them feel comfortable can spark new ideas and a more productive workplace.</li><br>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Example of Inclusion in the workplace</b><br><br>
          World Economic Forum conducted a survey that took an analysis of 100 companies and rated their religious inclusion in the workplace on a scale of how their variety of inclusion and faith-friendly was used in the workplace. The companies with the best scores were Tyson Foods, Target, American Airlines, and American Express. The aspects that these companies did well were creating respectful environments for the faith and beliefs of their employees. They found that employees were more excited to be a part of a company that accepted their religious diversity. 
          <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/religion-diversity-business-inclusion/#:~:text=Tyson%20Foods%2C%20Target%2C%20American%20Airlines,as%20models%20for%20other%20companies" target="_blank">[1]</a><br>
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, religious diversity betters our world with beliefs, traditions, and perspectives. It focuses on tolerance, 
          understanding, and empathy, which are all essential elements for a harmonious global society. By embracing and respecting the 
          religions that exist, we not only honor individual freedoms but also promote religious diversity in the workplace. In this world, 
          religious diversity serves as a beacon of hope, reminding us of the beauty found in acceptance and the power of coexistence. 
          As we navigate the complexities of our modern era, let us continue to celebrate the richness of our diverse religious landscape, 
          recognizing that it is through our differences that we find strength and solidarity.

        <h2>Gender<br>Diversity</h2>
        <author><p> By Ethan Pack</p></author>
      </div>
      <div class="textRight">
        <p>
          To understand what gender diversity is, we must learn the history and why it is taking so long to make drastic changes. For hundreds of years, the expectation of women was to stay at home and take care of children and their homes. Civilizations relied on the men to not only create nations but to build them up too. Women were overlooked and never given the chance to express their knowledge. This still occurs today with salary differences, job promotions, and work environments.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What is Gender Diversity?</b><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_diversity">[1]</a>
          <i>"It is equitable or fair representation of people of different genders. It most commonly refers to an equitable ratio of men and women, but also includes people of non-binary genders."</i><br><br> 
          Equitable representation of individuals across various genders is a fundamental aspect of gender diversity. It involves ensuring a balanced and fair distribution of opportunities, resources, and representation among people identifying as men, women, and non-binary genders. By acknowledging and embracing this diversity, organizations and societies can foster inclusivity and create environments where all individuals feel valued and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and talents. Striving for equitable gender representation not only promotes social justice but also enriches decision-making processes and promotes innovation by harnessing the full spectrum of human experiences and insights.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How does Gender Diversity Affect Women?</b><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Gender Diversity has been going on since before Christ. More recent studies show,<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-history-of-womens-work-and-wages-and-how-it-has-created-success-for-us-all/" target="_blank">[2]</a> In the early 20th century, most women in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were primarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Gender diversity has significantly impacted women over the years, catalyzing profound shifts in societal norms, opportunities, and perceptions. Historically marginalized and constrained by gender stereotypes, women have steadily gained ground in various spheres due to the advancement of gender diversity initiatives. These efforts have facilitated greater representation of women in traditionally male-dominated fields, improved access to education and employment opportunities, and heightened awareness of gender-based discrimination and inequality. Additionally, the embrace of gender diversity has empowered women to challenge restrictive gender roles, advocate for their rights, and aspire to leadership positions previously inaccessible to them.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How to Continue to Improve Gender Diversity?</b><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://factorialhr.com/blog/gender-diversity/" target="_blank">[3]</a>
          The first step in solving a problem is understanding it. That’s why it’s so important to educate yourself and your teams on issues related to the workplace gender gap. Remind your workforce that achieving gender diversity isn’t just about hiring more women and offering equal pay for equal work. It’s a cultural and organizational shift towards a more inclusive environment where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities that they need to succeed.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long term, organizations that prioritize racial diversity and equity are poised to reap significant benefits, including enhanced employee satisfaction, improved innovation, and strengthened brand reputation. By fostering inclusive environments where every individual feels valued and empowered, organizations can attract and retain top talent from diverse backgrounds, driving sustainable growth and competitiveness in the marketplace. Moreover, as societal attitudes continue to evolve, organizations that embrace diversity and equity will be better positioned to navigate changing demographics and consumer preferences.
          <br><br>

        <p>  
          <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/gender-equality-in-the-workplace-ways-to-improve/" target="_blank">[4]</a><b> 5 Steps to improve gender Diversity:</b><br><br>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Make a longer shortlist when recruiting:</b> Gender inequities can be inherent in informal recruitment processes, particularly in male-dominated industries.</li><br>
            <li><b>Remove the gender pay gap:</b> The gender pay gap measures the difference in average earnings between male and female employees. In 2020, women worldwide earned 81 cents for every US dollar earned by men. While this has improved over the years – up from 74 cents in 2015 – more work is needed, particularly as women are still less likely to negotiate their salary.</li><br>
            <li><b>Use skills-based assessments:</b> Asking candidates to perform tasks they would be expected to carry out in the role they are applying for enables organizations to assess their suitability based on their performance. These tasks need to be standardized across all applicants to ensure fairness.</li><br>
            <li><b>Have women mentor men:</b> Another way to improve gender equality in the workplace is by letting women mentor men. Mentoring in the workplace can prove invaluable in helping an employee progress in their career. The benefits of junior business women having a mentor to help break the barriers they face are well documented.</li><br>
            <li><b>Make work-life balance a priority.</b> Compared to men, women have children and need to be absent from work for months which can cause conflict within certain job fields. It’s important to allow for flexibility to ensure that women are being treated fairly within their circumstances.</li><br>

        <h2>LGBTQ+<br>Diversity </h2>
        <author><p> By Isaac Matti</p></author>
      </div>
      <div class="textRight">
        <p>
          The LGBTQ+ community has been on the rise in the last twenty years. In today's workplaces, it's vital to include LGBTQ+ individuals to promote diversity and equality. According to UCLA Williams Institute of Law, around 20% of LGBTQ+ employees in the US experience discrimination (UCLA, 2021). Inclusive workplaces not only attract top talent but also improve overall productivity. Despite progress, challenges like discrimination and lack of support remain. Therefore, it's crucial for businesses worldwide to create supportive environments where LGBTQ+ individuals can thrive professionally.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace is essential for several compelling reasons. Firstly, it's a matter of human rights and fairness. Research from the Human Rights Campaign highlights that LGBTQ+ individuals are disproportionately affected by workplace discrimination (HRC). Similarly, studies from the Williams Institute emphasize the prevalence of discrimination against LGBTQ+ employees stats like the one mentioned in the first paragraph. It is ridiculous that over 20% of the LGBTQ+ community experiences discrimination in a place where they are supposed to feel welcome and appreciated. By addressing these issues, individuals and organizations can work towards creating more equitable workplaces.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, diversity and inclusion have tangible benefits for businesses. Reports from  McKinsey & Company demonstrate the positive impact of diverse teams on innovation, decision-making, and financial performance. McKinsey's "Diversity Wins'' report found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability. Similarly, companies with ethnically and culturally diverse executive teams were 36% more likely to outperform financially (McKinsey & Company). It is clear to see that educating oneself about LGBTQ+ inclusion empowers businesses to leverage the strengths of their workforce and gain a competitive edge with their diversity.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, social attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals are evolving rapidly, driven by legal and cultural shifts. Understanding LGBTQ+ inclusion helps organizations navigate these changes effectively, fostering a workplace culture that respects and supports all employees regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Legal changes such as the legalization of same-sex marriage and increased visibility in media contribute to this evolving landscape, emphasizing the importance of adapting workplace policies and practices to create more inclusive environments.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the trajectory of LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace is crucial for anticipating both short-term adjustments and long-term transformations. In the short term, immediate responses to current events or legal changes are expected, such as updates to policies, diversity training, and formation of LGBTQ+ employee resource groups. Long term, we anticipate deeper shifts in workplace culture and societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+ inclusion, including broader acceptance, normalization of inclusive practices, and comprehensive diversity strategies. <br><br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Short-Term Changes:</b> <br> <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Immediate updates to policies</li><br>
            <li>Implementation of diversity training</li><br>
            <li>Formation of LGBTQ+ employee resource groups</li><br>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Long-Term Changes:</b> <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Broader acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals in leadership</li><br>
            <li>Normalization of inclusive practices</li><br>
            <li>Comprehensive diversity strategies</li><br>
          </ul>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on our discussion about LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace, it's evident that there's both immediate action and long-term transformation needed. Short-term changes, such as policy updates and diversity training, are crucial for addressing immediate needs and creating a more inclusive environment (Human Rights Campaign, Williams Institute). However, the real impact lies in the long-term shifts in workplace culture and societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals. Achieving broader acceptance and normalization of inclusive practices requires ongoing commitment from organizations and individuals alike (McKinsey & Company). Ultimately, fostering a truly inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and respected is not just about compliance—it's about embracing diversity as a strength and creating spaces where all employees can thrive.

        <h2>Racial<br>Diversity</h2>
        <author><p> By Jack Zammit</p></author>
      </div>

      <div class="textRight">
        <p>
          In today's constantly evolving world, it is imperative that diversity in the workplace is managed effectively for organizations looking to cultivate inclusive environments for their workplace community. Among the various types of diversity, racial diversity stands as a cornerstone, enriching the culture of an organization and encouraging innovation and engagement from employees. However, despite its importance, we still see ethnic homogeneity issues, suggesting it's not a thing of the past. In this section of this website, I will discuss the importance of racial diversity in the workplace by analyzing credible sources, anticipating short- and long-term changes, and providing practical strategies for promoting racial equity and inclusion.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a study by the Pew Research Center, a majority of workers say focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at work is a good thing. However, only a small portion of workers view racial diversity as important in their workplace. Unfortunately, this disparity is common and highlights the importance of prioritizing racial diversity. The study also points out differences in opinion across demographic groups, with Black workers expressing higher levels of concern regarding DEI compared to their White colleagues. Additionally, opinions vary across the political spectrum, with Democrats more supportive of diversity in the workplace than Republicans.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
        </p3>
        <p>
          A scholarly article from Boston College, titled <i>"Addressing Race in the Workplace: Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,"</i> emphasizes how important it is for workplaces to focus on racial diversity to help make their business more successful. Both research studies show statistical evidence supporting the predominance of non-Hispanic white individuals in various positions, despite the US population being more diverse now than ever before. This article, rather than focusing on differences, shows evidence of how racial diversity in the workplace can boost business outcomes. It also offers various strategies for implementing inclusion, including effective recruitment and retention practices.
          <br><br>

        <img class = "wideSmall" src="../bostonStats1.jpg" alt="Advance">
        <img class = "wideSmall" src="../bostonStats2.jpg" alt="Discussions at work">

          <a href="https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/centers/cwf/research/Publication%20Images/Race%20EBS%20FINAL.pdf " target="_blank">Source: Boston College</a><br>
          <br><br>
        </p4>
        <p>
          These statistics paint a concerning picture of the current state of racial dynamics in the workplace. Despite evidence suggesting disparities in advancement opportunities between Black and White employees, there remains a significant portion—43%—who believe that discussions about race are inappropriate at work. This sentiment highlights a broader issue: the reluctance or discomfort many individuals feel in addressing racial issues in professional settings. It begs the question: if not at work, where else are these crucial conversations supposed to take place?
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          What can organizations do to change in the short and long term? In the short term, organizations should expect an increase in awareness and scrutiny regarding their DEI policies, with businesses that don’t fit the current mold being heavily scrutinized due to a heightened consciousness about racial diversity among the general public. There are so many examples of this; the article <i>“5 Big Companies Sued for Racial Discrimination”</i> highlights a case where, “approximately 4,500 Black truck drivers who applied to work for Walmart between 2001 and 2008 filed a class-action suit against the corporation for racial discrimination … The company denied any wrongdoing but agreed to settle for $17.5 million.” Another point is that there may also be more pressure from stakeholders to make DEI efforts a priority because not only is it currently unacceptable to disregard diversity, but it also boosts business success, so in reality it’s a win-win.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long term, organizations that prioritize DEI efforts will see significant benefits, which include enhanced overall employee satisfaction, improved innovation, and strengthened brand reputation. By fostering a safe and diverse workplace where everyone feels equally important, regardless of their race, organizations can attract and retain top talent that they otherwise might not have had the chance to do if they were monocultural. Moreover, as society continues to evolve, organizations that embrace diversity and equity will find it easier to navigate changing demographics and consumer preferences in the future.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>  
          To support racial diversity in the workplace, organizations can adopt a multifaceted approach by incorporating various initiatives, here are 9 points from the article <i>“9 Ways to support racial diversity in the workplace”</i>:<br><br>

        <h2>Mental<br>Health<br>Diversity</h2>

          Mental health is one of the largest growing concerns in our nation. Data shows that in the United States, approximately 1 in 5 adults experience some form of mental illness each year, equating to roughly 40 million adults. The most prevalent mental health disorders include depression, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic, obsessive-compulsive, and post-traumatic stress disorders (Huges 2021). Unfortunately, this trend is likely to continue as recent events have further spurred an increase in the rise of mental health disorders, this includes; recent acts of violence due to racism, the difference in treatment during the COVID pandemic, the increase in housing prices, the murder of George Floyd, and beyond the scope of United States, protests for racial justice in the Israel Palestine conflict (Hughes 2021). These staggering numbers, alongside the trend of increasingly prevalent mental health disorders, imply that this issue is present in the workplace, and likely affects numerous employees. If managers want to have the most productive workspace possible, they must work hand in hand with HR to create a safe and inclusive environment. 
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this day and age learning to manage employees suffering from mental health disorders is imperative to operating a workplace at maximum efficiency. The non-profit Mind Share Partners conducted a study and found mental health is a vital factor in workplace productivity, well-being, and engagement. (Wong and Greenwood 2023). The conclusion this study draws is congruent with others, for example, experts at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences Diversity Summer Panel determined diversity, equity, and inclusion are about more than just race and culture, it extends to people's mental health and mental wellbeing. Embracing diversity offers support to communities facing harsh and unfair negative stigmas, mental health issues are one of the largest and least-discussed in the workplace. (Huges 2021). Mental health is also a huge monetary issue for employers, organizations spend over $15,000 annually on each employee experiencing mental health issues, making it one of the most expensive healthcare issues. (National Safety Council 2021).

          In the US the prevalence of mental health illness continues to fluctuate, during the COVID pandemic mental health symptoms spiked, with workers' overall view on their own mental health declining, while just last year in 2023 there was a 20% decline in those workers reporting symptoms. That being said, when those workers were asked to rate their overall mental health out of 10, 61% rated between seven and 10, with economic worries, and work itself having the largest negative impacts. Additionally, the majority of those suffering from mental health issues also need care for other physical health conditions. This can be especially problematic for a company's insurance, as the costs for treating people with both mental health disorders and other physical conditions are 2 to 3 times higher than for those without co-occurring illnesses (CDC 2019). By combining medical and behavioral health care, the United States could approximately $37.6 billion to $67.8 billion per year.

          As stated earlier, mental health illnesses drastically affect employees, which in turn affects the company as a whole, some specific ways they can be affected include; <br> <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Job performance and productivity</li><br>
            <li>Engagement with one’s work</li><br>
            <li>Communication with coworkers</li><br>
            <li>Physical capability and daily functioning</li><br>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          When looking at a specific mental health disorder such as depression it's clear the effect it can have on an employee's ability to work. Depression makes employees unable to complete physical job tasks about 20% of the time and reduces cognitive performance about 35% of the time. Furthermore, these numbers may be underrepresented as only 57% of employees who report moderate depression and 40% of those who report severe depression receive treatment to control depression symptoms (CDC 2019).
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though mental health is so rampant the majority of employers barely scratch the surface of effective support. Historically, this support primarily centers around a generalized individual approach, such as therapy, or time off. It is essentially forcing the employee to manage their mental health outside of work. This creates an unhealthy environment especially if work is the cause of the mental health issue, this can occur through conditions such as a perceived lack of control, unsustainable workloads, inadequate rewards, lack of community, lack of equality, and poor management (Wong and Greenwood 2023).

          <br><br>
          Because of the increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, change in the work environment is likely soon to follow. This change can come in a variety of forms including; increased awareness, access to educational resources, including mental wellness benefits, encouraging a healthy work-life balance, vocalizing leadership’s support in behavior changes, and continuously tracking engagement to keep the pulse of employee morale. Because mental health disorders are often invisible, they are often overlooked and stigmatized. This stigmatization can be seen through a study conducted by Workplace Options where they found 47% of employees worked at companies with no support or programs, an additional 11% weren't sure what their employers offered, while a mere 47% had support or programs. These suggestions may help curb this stigmatization, but managers will still need to work with their employees to create a healthy and inclusive work environment. They should attend relevant training to learn how to best handle, and approach situations where employees are facing mental health challenges.

          All in all, mental health is on the rise in America, its presence is and will continue to change the workforce, and managers must adapt to this change. As stated earlier, managers have a plethora of ways to help reduce the symptoms of mental health in their employees. This will not only lead to a happier, more stable workforce but also a more productive and efficient one. Managers can start this change as soon as they would like, by starting small with things such as informational videos, or starting large like mandatory training, they will be able to create a safe and inclusive workplace for all their employees.
